### Browser Extensions
Note: keeping your browser extensions to a minimum is good etiquette, so as to decrease your attack surface. extensions have privileged access within your browser, require you to trust the developer, can make you stand out (which makes it easier to track you), and weaken site isolation. Get uBlock Origin or use Brave Shields no matter what.
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) Adblocker, malware blocker, and tracker blocker. Blocks the visible AND invisible shittyness that comes with ads and other bullshit like them. The internet's condom. A must install if your browser supports manifest v2 extensions.
    - [uBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh) If your browser does not support [Manifest v2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18VM1xZQdXc) extensions and you insist on using a browser other than brave or firefox, use lite.
- [Image Search Options](https://saucenao.com/tools/) Reverse image search tool offered by saucenao.
- [Sponsorblock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) Skip youtube sponsors. Works better than you'd think it would. Also offers options to skip recaps, non-music sections of music videos, self-promo, and more.
    - [DeArrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app/) Alternative community sourced title/thumbnails to reduce clickbait. I recommend changing some settings to have the show original button to always display, and have the original title/thumb to display by default. That way you can just click a button next to a click-baity video to see the dearrow submitted title/thumbnail manually. I like this since it has a bad habit of spoiling some videos, and imo titles/thumbs are "part" of the video, artistically.
- [Annotations Restored](https://github.com/isaackd/AnnotationsRestored) Restores archived YouTube annotations. I only use this when I know a video used to have annotations and hope they were preserved.
- [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/) Save a ton of ram and clean up your tab bar with a single click. It'll roll all (or individual) tabs into a single tab as a list. It's OP, great for tab hoarders like myself.
- [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/) Fuck Fandom Wiki! If a community has an independent wiki not hosted on fandom, this extension gives you options to add a redirect link, automatically redirect you, and/or remove fandom-hosted wiki results from search engines. Here's a [list](https://getindie.wiki/listings/) of wikis they support. For wikis that are still on Fandom, it also gives you options to view those wikis on alternative frontends like Breezewiki.
    - Unfortunately, it doesn't auto-redirect wikis that have moved to [wiki.gg](https://wiki.gg/wikis/), but you can check their wiki list (linked) for wikis they host. Wiki.gg hosts a collection of gaming wikis and was created by a former Fandom and Gamepedia staff pair. It's essentially Gamepedia 2. It's not independent but anything is preferable to fandom.

### Userscripts
Note: Your browser must support Manifest v2 to take advantage of userscripts, which Google will kill in 2025. To use userscripts on chromium in the meantime, install another chromium browser other than google chrome, like brave. After manifest v2 is killed in chromium for good, you'll have to use firefox to take advantage of these.
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) An extension that lets you load userscripts. Think of them like modifications to websites, without being their own full extension. If an extension has a userscript version, jump for it. You can find userscripts I use below. Violentmonkey is private and open source. You can also use [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) if you're having compatibility issues, but it's not as lightweight.
- [Tampermonkey scripts list](https://www.tampermonkey.net/scripts.php) Page listing resources for finding new userscripts.
- [4chan X](https://www.4chan-x.net/) Chan boards it supports are basically unusable without it. Thread watcher, view full image on hover, board hotbar, catalog default, keybinds. It's OP.
- [Chrome Dark Scrollbar and Audio Player](https://userstyles.org/styles/108298) I was having trouble getting chrome themes to have a dark scrollbar, so here's a userscript for getting a dark scrollbar on chrome.
- [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/) More emotes, features, etc for twitch. Select "other" browser even if your browser is supported for the userscript.
- [Show Twitter Censored Media](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/491744-show-twitter-censored-media). Automatically unspoilers sensitive images when browsing a user's media tab on twitter
- [Twitter One Click Block](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/482477-one-click-copy-link-button-for-twitter-x) adds a block button next to people's usernames on twitter
- [TwitchAdSolutions](https://github.com/pixeltris/TwitchAdSolutions?tab=readme-ov-file) video-swap-new and vaft are userscripts provided on this page which can block ads on twitch, sense those tend to get through adblock.
- [Video Speed Buttons](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/30506-video-speed-buttons) lets you increase the playback of youtube videos past 2x. I recommend editing the userscript and changing the controller to VSC, since in my experience VSB slowly causes youtube to become unresponsive (changing it is easy).


### Discord Modifications
- [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) A modified desktop client. However, this one comes bundled with all of it's plugins, and the plugins can be enabled and disabled as you wish. Tons of useful stuff here. You can also create custom themes using css
    - [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop) A Discord client based on the browser version of the app, with vencord pre-installed. Offers better privacy as well as screenshare support on linux with wayland. Its also noticeably more lightweight. This is the client I recommend if you're on linux.
- [Bunny](https://github.com/pyoncord/Bunny) A modified client for Discord's mobile app. If you don't know if your device is rooted, it isn't. Get plugins from [bn-plugins](https://bn-plugins.github.io/vd-web/) or by installing [Nexpid's Plugin Browser](https://bn-plugins.github.io/vd-proxy/vendetta.nexpid.xyz/plugin-browser/) (available on bn-plugins). You're also able to use themes from [Revenge's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ddcQf3s2Uq).
- [Discord Embedder](https://discord.nfp.is/) Not an addon, just a website that lets you paste links to videos that may not be embedding in discord, and (sometimes) fixes them. Works with catbox. If you remember how the fnaf movie was being passed around awhile ago, it was using this.
- [Rebane's Discord Color Text Generator](https://rebane2001.com/discord-colored-text-generator/) NOT an addon, just a website that lets you generate colored text for discord. [Here's a video explaining it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtdOJCEIpvQ)
- [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) Betterdiscord is a modified client for Discord on desktop. It does not come with all its plugins pre-installed like vencord does. You can find plugins from the [BetterDiscord Plugins](https://betterdiscord.app/plugins) site
