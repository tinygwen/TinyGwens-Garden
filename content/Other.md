- [Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/) is a site dedicated to sharing information relating to gender-affirming transfeminine hormone (replacement) therapy (HRT). The articles on this site are wiki-esque living documents, and hence may be updated, expanded, and improved over time, however it should be noted that not anyone can edit or add information to the site. It is never too late to transition.
    - [diyhrt.wiki](https://diyhrt.wiki/) Do It Yourself Hormone Replacement Therapy. Especially useful if the system is failing you (underdosing, gatekeeping, waitlisting, potentially even banning if SCOTUS decides to be particularly evil soon), but even barring that it's an alternative to be considered to give you more control over your transition and possibly even save you some dosh. Both feminizing and masculinizing hormone replacements are covered. Also just a good resource for learning about hrt and it's effects in general (which you really ought to do. Most doctors do not have the time or need to research the ins and outs of transition, and are... safe but surprisingly very ignorant).
    - [hrt.cafe](https://hrtcafe.net/) a repository of reputable distributors to actually buy diy-hrt from
- [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) best site to test keyboards and your WPM. If you want to battle people in real time, I recommend [Typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) though
- [TheraminTrees](https://www.youtube.com/@TheraminTrees) a YouTube channel explores issues around abuse, manipulation, dogma, and systems of undue influence. Hosted by a licensed therapist. Life-changing stuff inside.
- [Catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/) A nice, free, minimum bullshit image and file cloud. Also check out [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/) for hosting files which are temporary in nature and can just be deleted whenever (this is a homegrown project ran at a loss most months, be nice and be reasonable).
- [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/) A website dedicated to harm-reduction and education for a number of drugs. Includes sitable and non-sitable information (such as personal experiences, opinion pieces, media writings, etc., etc.,)
- [MyTime.io](https://mytime.io/) great for creating one link that a bunch of people in different timezones can use to coordinate. Basically, you format the url as something like mytime.io/13:00/PT or mytime.io/1pm/PT to have 1pm PT converted into your timezone automatically. It'll give the correct time for anyone connecting. Be sure to turn off your VPN and tell everyone else to as well for it to work!
- [Just The Recipe](https://www.justtherecipe.com/) Paste in a recipe from a recipe site and remove all of their bullshit lifestories and clutter
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) A website you're probably using wrong. It's invaluable for finding information within or about a given hobby, product, or niche. Tired of shitty listicles you get from your search engine when you just want to know what a good xyz is? Or how to fix a problem? or-- Reddit. Literally just add `site:reddit.com` to your searches (or whatever the format is in your favorite search engine is) and you'll get better results. Edit: this only works with google for recent information due to an exclusivity deal. what the fuck. (startpage, searx, and kagi should still work since they all index from google, but jesus)
