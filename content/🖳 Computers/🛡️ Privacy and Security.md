## General
#### 🌟 [Privacy Guides](https://privacyguides.org/)
Basically the authority in protecting your privacy and making your digital life more secure, in my opinion. Check in every now and then to see up to date information. This should be your first resource for privacy/security everything. Including software recommendation.
#### [Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/c/Techlore)
A YouTube channel that posts super helpful recommendations and guides on all things privacy. Also hosts a weekly show called [Surveillance Report](https://www.youtube.com/surveillancereport) ([old episodes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3KeV6Ui_4CZemCIsHUIuEtugAmUxAYHS)) which recaps news and important events in the quickly everchanging world of privacy. They also have a [website](https://techlore.tech).
#### [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail)
Privacy focused e-mail service. Their front page is a little bit misleading about what it can do, and quite frankly e-mail just is straight up not a private or particularly secure protocol, but at least they're not selling your data. Will not protect you from feds (no e-mail service will).
#### 🌟 [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
Best cloud password manager. Free, secure, private, and functional. Export your current password vault and import it into bitwarden asap :)
#### [Signal Messenger](https://www.signal.org/)
Messenger app. Fast, easy, private, secure. E2EE, VOIP video/voice calls, voice messenges, emoji reactions, stories, group chats, free stickers (make your own sticker packs and download packs by others), I can go on. Even if it's primary draw is that it's private and secure, it's so easy, functional, and well made that you might just be able to get your family and friends to use it just because it's a good messenger. That's even if they don't care about privacy.
#### [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
open-source, decentralized, and privacy focused alternative to discord. Also supplies [bridges](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/) that lets you send and receive messages from many other chat services including discord, signal, telegram, facebook messenger, SMS, whatsapp, and more.
#### [Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/)
Test your browser to see how well you are protected from fingerprinting and tracking. Also an educational demonstration of how easy it is to identify and track your browser.
#### [Alternative Front Ends](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends)
sites like youtube, reddit. twitter, imgur, imdb, genius, google translate, and whatever else are often filled with bloat, trackers, and other creepy bullshit you don't need that downloads way too much data; not only violating your privacy, but hogging internet resources to do so. These alternative front ends simply deliver the content you want to see without the bullshit. If these interest you, you may also want to check out [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.github.io/), a browser extension that automatically redirects you to said alternative front ends.

#### [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
Fast, private, no bullshit VPN. Transparency reports, warrant canaries, the works. No 2FA, unfortunately. Ran by the Proton Suite team. Priced at $48/yr for basic and $96/yr for preimum at the time of writing. They also offer a free version with less features.
#### [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/)
Fast, private, no bullshit VPN that openly tells you what a VPN is and isn't good for and if you actually need one. Transparency reports, warrant canaries, 2FA. Supports Wireguard. Email-less signup option. Priced at $60/yr for standard and $100/yr for pro.
#### [RiseupVPN](https://riseup.net/en/vpn)
A free and Private VPN. It and CalyxVPN are the only free VPNs I trust. Unfortunately has few locations and can be slow. Don't use unless you need, the extra traffic makes it slow for others that need this.
#### [CalyxVPN](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/digital-services/vpn)
A free and private VPN. It and Riseup are the only free VPNs I trust. Unfortunately only has 1 location and can be slow. Don't use unless you need, the extra traffic makes it slow for others that need this.
