title: Welcome to TinyGwen's Garden :3c
---
Here you will find collection of things I personally use, think are useful, or that I think are generally neat. I want to both shine light on things that deserve more attention as well as provide peers with what amounts to a repository of services, tools, and even tutorials to some extent. Oh, and there's cool stuff too. This site was made with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) btw!

> [!tip] Consider bookmarking if you find this valuable :D
> Ironically enough i personally use it all the time, even though I made it x3

#### How do I navigate the garden?
Some items could easily fit in more than one category. Use the search and nav-bar on the left to find what you're looking for. Items are in no particular order. If you find something interesting, you can middle click it to open it in a new tab :)
