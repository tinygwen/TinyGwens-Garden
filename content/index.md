title: Welcome to TinyGwen's Garden :3c
---
Here you will find collection of things I personally use, think are useful, or that I think are generally neat. I want to both shine light on things that deserve more attention as well as provide peers with what amounts to a repository of services, tools, and even tutorials to some extent. Oh, and there's cool stuff too. This site was made with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) btw!

> [!info] Consider bookmarking if you find this valuable :D
> Ironically enough i personally use it all the time, even though I made it x3

> [!warning] Please install [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), regardless of if you use any resources listed here.
uBlock is more than just an adblocker. It's a tracker blocker, malware blocker, phisher blocker. It often makes sites faster and absolutely keeps you safer. ABP is not good enough, and is shady. Use uBO.
>> [!note] **uBO will break on chromium based browsers soon** 
>> This is due to Google's push for [manifest v3](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation) and its seemingly targeted approach to crippling adblock. If you want to use uBO, userscripts, and other extensions which rely on how manifest v2 handles extensions, please switch to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and harden it (check the software section in [[Hardware and Software]] for hardening resources).
If you don't want to switch to firefox, try [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/). It comes with Brave Shields, which is a serviceable uBO replacement. 

#### Notice any typos, broken links, or out-of-date information? 
Please open an [issue](https://github.com/tinygwen/TinyGwens-Garden/issues), or create a [pull request](https://github.com/tinygwen/TinyGwens-Garden/pulls).
You may also open an [issue](https://github.com/tinygwen/TinyGwens-Garden/issues) if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions.

#### How do I navigate the garden?
Some items could easily fit in more than one category. Use the search and nav-bar on the left to find what you're looking for. Items are in no particular order. If you find something interesting, you can middle click it to open it in a new tab :)
