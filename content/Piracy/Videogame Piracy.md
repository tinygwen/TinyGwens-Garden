> [!warning]- Please check the VPN section in [[Privacy and Security]] if you'll be torrenting
> Torrenting exposes your ip address to others using the torrent, since its a p2p protocol. Intellectual property holders often look for people in torrents which distribute their content and automatically send takedown requests to their ISPs to deter piracy.
> This is also technically a risk with other p2p services. a vpn will prevent this. This isn't _really_ a problem with direct-downloads, though.

## Console/Retro Games
- [No-Intro Romsets](https://archive.org/details/ni-romsets) This is a database of roms available for download that match no-intro's official set. Add `/` after the URLs to view the contents of compressed archives from the browser. Torrents can be problematic, and you may have an easier time if you use a download manager like jdownloader if you're downloading in bulk. [No-Intro](https://no-intro.org/) is a group that basically makes the standard database for making sure your roms are clean, but they dont provide the roms themselves, so this (and every) romset isn't official.
    - [Redump ISO sets](https://archive.org/details/redump). There isn't an entry for every redumped system in one listing on internet archive that i've been able to locate, but this collection should get you started. [Redump](http://redump.org/) is a very similar organization to no-intro, just for discs instead of cartridges. For the Ctrl+F friends: PSX, PS1, Playstation, PS2, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, WiiU, PSP, Vita, Saturn, Dreamcast, 64DD. Also see the link below if you're a ctrl+f friend
    - [Modern-ish Systems (PS3/4, Switch, etc)](https://rentry.org/-hbg-archive#games-download) A megalist for each. Download then install on each system with it's default backup installation method. Check Hacking & Homebrew Resources below for more info on how to install the games onto your console.
    - [ISO and Rom Sites directory via the emulation wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/ROM_%26_ISO_sites) a bunch of sites to download retro games, listed on the emulation wiki.
- [Patched English Translation ROMs](https://archive.org/details/En-ROMs) English fan translations of various games, pre-patched and ready to go.
- [Gamecube Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/GamecubeCollectionByGhostware) Full North American ISO set of gamecube games. Be sure to log in and either show all files and pick which you want, or get the torrent and manage from there in your torrent manager.
- [Wii Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostware), [Part 2](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostwarePart2), [Part 3](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostwarePart3), [WiiWare/Virtual Console](https://archive.org/details/WiiWareCollectionByGhostware) Multi-part collection of commercial Wii games. Be sure to log in and either show all files and pick which you want, or get the torrent and manage from there in your torrent manager.
- [NXBrew (Switch)](https://nxbrew.com/) Switch piracy downloads and torrents
    - [Ghostland (Switch)](https://ghostland.at/) eShop replacement for Switch using [Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.io/Download). use `https` as protocol, `nx.ghostland.at` as host, and `/` as path.)
- [hShop (3DS)](https://hshop.erista.me/) eShop replacement for 3DS with free downloads. A must install since the eShop is deprecated. Has all games that were on the eShop including updates and DLC.
- [Software Clearance Bin](https://archive.org/details/clearancebin) Huge collection of commercial abandonware. Not my first line of fire for seeking out a specific title, but SUPER fun to meander about and see some random shovelware game you played as a kid and go "omg I'm gonna pop this in rn like right now rn".
- [Legal ROMs Wiki (Fandom)](https://legal-roms.fandom.com/) Yeah its a fandom wiki but its still pretty neat. A list of ways you can legally acquire digital versions of plenty of retro games. You probably own a few games that are incredibly trivial to pull roms of and may not even know it. A nice option to have.
    - [Legal ROMs on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997730346) A guide for how to pull ROMs from various games on steam. 
## PC Games
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Repacks for modern games. (Repacks are compressed versions of games, I've rarely had problems with them though). As for other repackers, fitgirl endources RG Mechanics, RG Revenants, RG Catalyst, Xatab, El Amigos, Kapital Sin, and KaosKrew (rips). However I've never had to use them.
- [Free GOG Games](https://freegogpcgames.com/) Free release for almost every game on GOG.
- [CreamInstaller](https://github.com/pointfeev/CreamInstaller) DLC unlocker tool based on [CreamAPI](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=70576) and more. Lets you unlock paid DLC for legitimately owned games for free, though if the DLC is a separate download you'll need to track that down and merge it. I use it for the PinballFX games, since all those have all their dlc packed into the game lol. Works online too! Just know developers could easily track this and ban you if they went out of their way to. Steam probably could as well, though there's no recorded cases of valve taking any action against people that use this. Use CreamAPI or other tools directly if you're on Linux.
- [Pirated Games Mega Thread](https://rentry.org/pgames) Lists resources curated by those at r/CrackWatch, as well as some anti-recommendations so you know what to watch out for. Anything on my list superseeds anything there (at least for me) obviously.
- [Old Games Finder](http://www.oldgamesfinder.com/) Search engine to find copies of old PC games. Some sites it may lead you to are paid, but not all. Use Archive.org as another line of fire.
- [r/CrackWatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/) Gaming piracy subreddit. Will tell you who cracked a game and removed it's DRM if a game has been cracked, which should give you enough information on where to find said cracked game. Also carries with it other useful info. Be sure to read the beginners guide on the sidebar.
- [Internet Arcade](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade) A bunch of retro games are playable in browser on Archive.org. If you dont want to go through the trouble of setting up an emulator and downloading roms and you just need an instant way to check out an old game for some reason, this should be your first stop. Surprisingly good support since it uses a javascript port of MAME. Here's [Libble-Rabble](https://archive.org/details/arcade_liblrabl) as an example because I love that game.
- [Flashpoint](https://flashpointarchive.org/) A project meant to be an exhaustive preservation of flash games and animations.
    - [Flash on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_flash) Similarly to the Internet Arcade, Archive.org also supports playing flash games in browser using [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/), which [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/) also does for flash games that have remained on the site.
