> [!warning]- check out the VPN section in [[Privacy and Security]] if you'll be torrenting
> Torrenting exposes your ip address to others using the torrent, since its a p2p protocol. Intellectual property holders often look for people in torrents which distribute their content and automatically send takedown requests to their ISPs to deter piracy.
> This is also technically a risk with other p2p services. a vpn will prevent this. This isn't _really_ a problem with direct-downloads, though.
## General Piracy
- [r/FREEMEDIAFUCKYEAH's wiki](https://reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index), ([old.reddit ver](https://old.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index)) A huge curated mega list of piracy resources. If you can't find something elsewhere, check here.
	- [Awesome Piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) is another huge list many used, however due to lack of maintenance many of the links are outdated as the repo has been archived, but the source is incredibly invaluable none-the-less. [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme) lists in general are very useful to be honest.
    - The author of Awesome Piracy has recommended a couple other mega-lists (including FMFY, [a maintained fork of awesome piracy](https://github.com/Shakil-Shahadat/awesome-piracy), and [the r/piracy wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread)) in the [repo's archival announcement](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy/issues/724)
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) Site used to archive a bunch of stuff. Also home of the wayback-machine. Basically the library of the internet as far as media is concerned. So much is on here it's ridiculous. If you're in a collection, be sure to view all files on the right panel if you're looking for a specific file. Some may require you to sign in. A favorite of mine for roms, books, in-browser emulation, and flash games. Has tons of entries on this list.
- [Pirate Bay Mirrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePirateBays/comments/15hdz1y/the_pirate_bay_proxies_list_updated_august_2023/) Updated Aug 2023. List of mirror sites pulling from The Pirate Bay's database. Visiting the pirate bay directly is sketchy in my opinion, but it's database will always be invaluable. Do note however that in more recent times, their collection has become more and more unmoderated. Tread lightly. I do not recommend the subreddit's suggested VPNs.
- [TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentgalaxy.to/) Movie torrenting site. I'm using it to hold me over since RARBG went defunct. Not sure what the best alternative is yet.
- [Piracy.moe](https://piracy.moe/) Previously known as the anime index. A resource to find ways to pirate/stream anime, manga, etc. Just a good resource for weeb piracy warez n' such.
- [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/) Anime torrenting database. Probably the best out there. My first line of fire for anime piracy. [sukebei.nyaa.si](sukebei.nyaa.si) is their NSFW counterpart.
- [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) Peer-to-Peer network for (mostly) music piracy. A lot like how Limewire worked (I think? idk I was too young for it). If you're on Linux I recommend using [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) to access soulseek.
- [YayPonies](https://yayponies.no/) Piracy site for basically all official digital media for the My Little Pony franchise. shows, movies, comic books, bonus features, etc. They also host [other shows](https://yayponies.no/othersshow/index.php), including Bluey, Star Vs The Forces of Evil and Wander Over Yonder (as well as Ducktales and Steven Universe, albeit deprecated).
